## DeDispersion, implemented in Julia.

<div align="justify">

This is a work-in-progress implementation of the dedispersion algorithm, used in
time-domain radio astronomy, in [**Julia**][julia]. Dedispersion is often the
main bottleneck in real-time search pipelines for pulsars and radio transients,
and hence it is implemented in low-level languages, such as C, C++, FORTRAN, or
CUDA (for GPUs). This package hopes to demonstrate that similar speeds, on both
the CPU and the GPU, can be obtained with a high-level language as well. To
drive this point home, I have benchmarked `DeDisp.jl` versus `prepsubband`,
which is the CLI that implements dedispersion in `PRESTO`, one of the most used
libraries in pulsar astronomy:

For more details on how this benchmark was generated, have a look at the
[**`bench/README.md`**](bench/README.md) file, which gives a detailed look into
the entire process.
